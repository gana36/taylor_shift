						<p><span>H</span>Her eponymous debut studio album (2006) included the Hot Country Songs chart-topping singles "Our Song" and "Should've Said No" and the pop radio crossover "Teardrops on My Guitar". Swift rose to mainstream prominence with her country pop second studio album, Fearless (2008), which was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and featured the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 top-five singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me". Her third studio album, Speak Now (2010), blended country pop with elements of rock and contained the top-ten singles "Mine" and "Back to December".</p>

						<h2 class="universal-h2 universal-h2-bckg">About Taylor Swift</h2>
						<p><span>H</span>Swift's fourth studio album, Red (2012), experimented beyond country, incorporating pop, rock, and electronic genres. She transitioned fully to pop with her synth-pop fifth studio album, 1989 (2014), while its successor, Reputation (2017), expanded on the electropop sound with urban influences. Her seventh studio album, Lover, was released in 2019 amid a dispute over the ownership of her masters after her Big Machine contract expired. Swift explored indie folk and alternative rock on her 2020 studio efforts, Folklore and Evermore. These six albums collectively spawned the international top-ten singles "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together", "I Knew You Were Trouble", "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", "Bad Blood", "Look What You Made Me Do", "Me!", "You Need to Calm Down", "Cardigan", and "Willow". Swift has also released five documentaries throughout her career, including the critically acclaimed Miss Americana and Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions in 2020.</p>

						<p>To me, Fearless is not the absense of fear. It's not being completely unafraid. To me, Fearless is having fears. Fearless is having doubts. Lots of them. To me, Fearless is living in spite of those things that scare you to death.</p>

					<p>An amazing thing about my friendship with Taylor has been that she is a songwriter that I've connected to through my childhood into my adult life, and becoming friends has given me an insight into the mind that creates those lyrics. She writes words that people experience but can't put into words themselves.</p>
